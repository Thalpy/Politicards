# Guide to Card Trigger-Effects

For objects with Trigger Effects Str - this is where you can add trigger-effect combos to an object (i.e. card/crisis).
The title is the name of the effect - this goes verbatim into the Effect Name section in the Unity Editor.
The vars are variable in length depending on how many variables the effect has.
Each part will list how many vars to enter, the order in crutial.

## Effects

---

### Draw

---
Draws a card  
Vars 1:  
[0] The number of cards drawn  


### Discard

---

Discard a card  
Vars 1:  
[0] The number of cards discarded  


### Power

---

Adjusts the power var of a specific faction - negatives remove, positives add.  
Vars 2:  
[0] The strength of the effect (10 will add 10)  
[1] The faction index to target or the name of the faction  


### Happiness

---

Adjusts the happiness var of a specific faction - negatives remove, positives add.  
Vars 2:  
[0] The strength of the effect (10 will add 10)  
[1] The faction index to target or the name of the faction  


### Progress

### Double

---

Doubles the object's effects to be 2x as powerful.  
Vars:

---

## Triggers

No vars needed.

Vars 1:  
[0] The card name that triggers this effect.
